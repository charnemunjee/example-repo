# Nike Inventory Programme
## Purpose
The purpose of the code is to keep track of the stock of shoes in a Nike shoe store.
The code is useful for storing information about a type of Nike shoe stocked by the store. The information includes:
- Country in which the shoe was manufactured
- Code of the shoes stocked by the Nike store
- Product Name of the shoes stocked by the store
- Cost of each type of shoe
- Quantity of each type of Nike shoe in stock

This allows managers to make decisions about which shoes need to be placed on sale and the shoes that need to be restocked

## What the code does

### Create a shoe database
The initial shoe database can be created from the inventory.txt file. This is a list of all the shoes, their names, quantities, codes, country of manufacture and cost

### Capture Shoes
The user is able to add a type of shoe to the Nike stock. They need to include the shoe name, shoe code, shoe country, cost and qunatity

### View all
The user is able to view all the shoes in stock

### Restock
The user can use the re-stock function to find the shoe with the lowest stock. The user has the option to order more stock. If the user choses to order more stock, they will be asked to enter the quantity that will be bought and it will be added to the stock of Nike shoes

### Search shoe
The user can search for a shoe and print out the details for the shoe. The details will include:
- Country in which the shoe was manufactured
- Code of the shoes stocked by the Nike store
- Product Name of the shoes stocked by the store
- Cost of each type of shoe
- Quantity of each type of Nike shoe in stock

### Value per item
The user can print a report that calculates the total value of each particular type of shoe.
The total value is calculated as the quantity of the shoe multiplied by the shoe cost

### Highest Quantity
The user can find the shoe with the highest quantity (stock levels). The code will suggest that these shoes be put on sale
## Implementation
Open and save the inventory.txt and inventory.py file in the same folder and run the inventory.py file
